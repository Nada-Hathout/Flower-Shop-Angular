##Description
Angular Flower Shop Project

This project is a modern, responsive web application built with Angular, designed to serve as an online flower shop. It allows users to browse a variety of fresh flowers and floral arrangements, filter products by categories, and view detailed product information. The application features a clean and user-friendly interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Key features include:

Dynamic product listing with categories such as bouquets, indoor plants, and gifts.

Filtering and sorting options to help users find the perfect flowers easily.

Detailed product pages with images, descriptions, and pricing.

Integration with backend APIs to fetch real-time product data.

Shopping cart functionality for adding and managing selected items.

Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices.



## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
